# Data-Mining-Pattern-Recognition

Social media is increasingly being used to broadcast useful information during local crisis situations (e.g. hurricanes, earthquakes, protests, accidents, attacks), as well as to discuss global-scale crises (e.g. climate change, pandemics).

CrisisLex.org is a repository of crisis-related social media data and tools. Currently it includes collections of crisis data and a lexicon of crisis terms. It also includes tools to help you create these collections and lexicons.

This repository is a study done to understand the pattern of the collection of 6 different hazards.
